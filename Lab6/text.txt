O Lithuania, my native land,
you are like health--so valued when lost beyond recovery
let these words now stand restoring you, redeeming exile's cost.
A larchwood manor stood upon the banks
of a stream, dividing groves of birch, its stone foundation propping up the solid ranks
of oak beams and whitewashed walls, which shone in stark relief against the darker green
of poplars all around.
Even stranger would face, like guest, a welcome sight, a gate, open by day, unlatched at night.
