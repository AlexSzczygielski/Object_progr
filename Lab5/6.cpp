/*
Class circle should inherit from Figure, as it inherits coordinates and label. Rectangle and Square have
properties that circle doesn't have (height, width, etc.), therefore it should'nt and can't inherit from 
the above. The proper approach would be to create new class Circle, which would inherit from Figure.
